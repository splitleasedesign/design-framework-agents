# Agent 4 (How it Feels) — Memory

## Session Log

- [2026-02-09] host-dashboard-emotion-map-and-copy-system | outcome: PASS (all 10 eval criteria met, 0 retries) | gaps: 2 critical, 5 high, 1 medium | files: reports/emotion-map-host-dashboard.md, reports/intervention-specs.md, reports/alternatives-considered.md, copy/copy-system-host-dashboard.md, copy/success-messages.md, copy/error-messages.md, copy/empty-states.md, copy/onboarding-copy.md, copy/personality-guide.md | decisions: (1) Dynamic welcome subtitle over persona-adaptive or card format, (2) Zero-earnings shows narrative not $0, (3) Proposal banner reframed from warning to opportunity — rejected social-proof pressure as borderline manipulation, (4) Onboarding reframed task-to-progress not gamified, (5) Offline badge gets inline reason+fix not separate status page, (6) Empty states get contextual guidance with max-3 cascade rule, (7) Referral banner gated until first completed booking, (8) Manage renamed to Edit Listing | patterns: (1) Bare zeros in large font are the most emotionally damaging UI element for new users, (2) Warning visual language (yellow/!) for positive events (proposals) is a common misframing, (3) Empty states cascade — when a new user sees 6 empty fields at once the cumulative effect is worse than any individual one, (4) Persona tone shift should be felt not announced | next: Implement copy strings in HTML mockup, coordinate with Agent 3 on visual tokens for celebration animations
- [2026-02-09] emotional-audit-version-c | outcome: Complete (Identified "Cold" Purples) | tokens: Audited Palette Warmth | files: reports/emotional-audit-version-c.md | decisions: Add Gold Accents | patterns: Procedural Placeholders | next: Implement Delight

## Running Lists

- `EMOTIONS_MAPPED:` Hero Load (Curiosity→Confidence), Proposal (Anxiety→Safety), Welcome (Cautious Hope→Grounded Confidence), Earnings Zero (Deflation→Patient Optimism), Proposals (Excited Anxiety→Eager Anticipation), Onboarding (Dutiful Slog→Empowered Momentum), Offline Badge (Worried Confusion→Informed Calm), Empty States (Inadequacy Cascade→Guided Action), Referral Banner (Premature Sales Pitch→not shown for new hosts)
- `COPY_SYSTEMS:` [2026-02-09]: host-dashboard: success/error/empty/onboarding/personality complete (9 files)
- `DELIGHT_MOMENTS:` Day Picker interaction (tactile), "New" badges (Gold accent), First-earnings confetti (contained in card, 1.5s), Onboarding completion (5-step green flash + title crossfade), Proposal-as-opportunity (purple card, guest interest framing)
- `ANXIETY_POINTS:` Empty state placeholders (feel cheap/unfinished), Dark purple dominance (feels corporate/cold), Bare $0 in 40px bold (most damaging element for new hosts), Yellow warning banner for proposals (codes good news as problem), "Complete Your Host Profile" framing (feels like homework), Offline badge with no explanation (confusion+worry), Referral banner shown to zero-earnings host (premature ask)
- `MANIPULATION_REJECTED:` Social proof pressure for proposals ("3x more bookings" stat to drive response time), Gamified onboarding rewards (withholding features to force completion), Competitive comparison ("You're ahead of 65% of hosts")
