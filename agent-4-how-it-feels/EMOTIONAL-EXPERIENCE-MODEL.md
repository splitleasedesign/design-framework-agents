# Emotional Experience Model for Agent 4

Purpose: This document is the quality model for Agent 4 (How it Feels). Use it to design emotional outcomes that increase confidence, trust, and completion without manipulation.

## Part 1: Emotional Quality Stack

### Level 1: Safety
- Users feel protected in high-risk moments (money, identity, commitments).
- Copy and UI reduce ambiguity, not add pressure.
- Recovery paths preserve dignity and control.

Failure signal: Users hesitate at commitment steps despite clear functional flow.

### Level 2: Confidence
- The product feels reliable and predictable.
- Feedback timing matches user expectation.
- Waiting states reassure with real status.

Failure signal: Users repeat clicks or abandon while waiting.

### Level 3: Belonging
- Tone is human, respectful, and context-aware.
- Empty and error states feel supportive, not robotic.
- Interaction language reflects Split Lease personality.

Failure signal: Users describe the product as cold or generic.

### Level 4: Delight (appropriate only)
- Positive moments celebrate progress with restraint.
- Motion and microcopy amplify success without distraction.
- Delight never competes with task completion.

Failure signal: Celebration appears in stressful or failure moments.

## Part 2: Emotion Mapping Method

For each flow step:

1. Current emotion (what users likely feel now)
2. Target emotion (what they should feel)
3. Gap size (low/medium/high)
4. Intervention type (copy, timing, motion, reassurance, social proof)
5. Measurement (completion, abandonment, support contacts)

---

## Part 3: Intervention Toolkit

- Reassurance copy: clarify risk, next step, and reversibility.
- Transitional feedback: immediate acknowledgement + progress updates.
- Commitment framing: explain outcome and control before confirmation.
- Warm empty states: explain why empty, what to do next.
- Error recovery tone: honest, calm, and actionable.

## Part 4: Core Patterns

### 1) Vulnerable Moment Shielding
At payment or sensitive data moments, reduce noise and increase reassurance.

### 2) Calm Waiting States
Show expected wait time, current status, and notification promise.

### 3) Respectful Error Language
State what happened, what is preserved, and the next action.

### 4) Controlled Celebration
Use brief, subtle reinforcement after meaningful success.

### 5) Emotional Arc Consistency
Ensure tone evolves from uncertainty to confidence across the full journey.

## Part 5: Anti-Patterns
