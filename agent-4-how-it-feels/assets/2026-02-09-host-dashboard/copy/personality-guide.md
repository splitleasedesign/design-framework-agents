## Brand Voice (Constant)

Split Lease speaks like a **knowledgeable neighbor** — someone who's been hosting for years, knows the ropes, and genuinely wants you to succeed. Not a corporate entity. Not a cheerleader. Not a boss.

**Core voice attributes:**
- **Direct.** We say what we mean in the fewest clear words.
- **Warm but grounded.** We care about the host's success, and we show it through practical help, not effusive praise.
- **Honest.** We don't sugarcoat bad news or inflate good news.
- **Action-oriented.** We don't just describe a situation — we point to the next step.

## Tone Per Persona

### New Host (First Listing, Pre-First Booking)

**Tone:** Encouraging, patient, specific. Slightly more explanatory. We assume nothing about their knowledge.

**Emotional posture:** "I've got your back. This is new, and that's okay. Here's exactly what to do next."

**Key adjustments:**
- More words, not fewer. New hosts need context.
- Always include "why" when asking them to do something.
- Use time estimates to reduce effort anxiety.
- Celebrate small wins (each onboarding step completed).
- Never assume they understand hosting terminology.

**Example — Onboarding next step:**
"Next up: House Manual (about 5 minutes). Guests love knowing what to expect — this step helps you get better proposals."

**Example — Empty state (no photos):**
"Listings with photos get noticed first. Start with a photo of the main room — it takes less than a minute."

**Example — First proposal received:**
"A guest is interested in your space! Take a look at their proposal when you're ready."

**Example — Earnings zero:**
"Your first earning is on its way. Your listing has been viewed 23 times this week. Guests are noticing."

---

### Active Host (1-3 Listings, Has Completed Bookings)

**Tone:** Motivating, efficient, growth-focused. Less hand-holding, more momentum.

**Emotional posture:** "You've got this. Let's keep growing."

**Key adjustments:**
- Fewer explanations, more data. Active hosts know the basics.
- Frame everything as growth and optimization.
- Use comparisons to last month to show trajectory.
- Acknowledge their effort and results.
- Skip the "why" for familiar tasks — jump to action.

**Example — Welcome subtitle:**
"Your listings earned $2,847 this month — up 12% from January."

**Example — Proposal notification:**
"2 guests are interested in your space. Take a look when you're ready."

**Example — Offline listing:**
"Offline — paused by you. Resume listing to start receiving proposals."

**Example — Monthly summary:**
"February was your best month yet. You earned $2,847 across 3 listings."

### Power Host (4+ Listings, Regular Activity)

**Tone:** Concise, data-dense, respectful of their time. Minimal decoration. Maximum information.

**Emotional posture:** "You know what you're doing. Here's the data."

**Key adjustments:**
- Strip all motivational language. Power hosts find it patronizing.
- Lead with numbers, not narratives.
- Use abbreviations they understand (MTD, occupancy %, proposals pending).
- Provide power-user features: batch actions, sorting, priority flags.
- Never explain what a feature does — they already know.

**Example — Welcome subtitle:**
"3 online, 2 proposals pending, $2,847 MTD."

**Example — Proposal notification:**
"2 proposals pending. Oldest: 2 days ago."

**Example — Offline listing:**
"Offline — missing house manual. Add it now."

**Example — Earnings:**
"$2,847 MTD (+12%). See breakdown."

## Tone Per Context (Cross-Persona)

### Celebrations (First Booking, Milestone, Positive Review)

**All personas:** Warm, genuine, brief. One moment of warmth, then move on.

| Persona | Copy |
|---------|------|
| New Host | "You just earned your first payout on Split Lease. This is just the beginning." |
| Active Host | "$2,847 this month — your best February yet." |
| Power Host | "MTD: $2,847. +12% MoM." |

**Rule:** Celebrations use at most one exclamation mark. Never two. Never for routine actions.

---

### Errors and Failures

**All personas:** Calm, specific, recovery-focused. Never blame the host.

| Persona | Copy |
|---------|------|
| New Host | "Your changes didn't save. Check your connection and try again — your draft is still here." |
| Active Host | "Changes didn't save. Check your connection and try again." |
| Power Host | "Save failed. Retry." |

**Rule:** Error messages always include what to do next. Never just say what went wrong.

---

### Waiting and Loading States

**All personas:** Factual and brief. No false reassurance.

| Persona | Copy |
|---------|------|
| New Host | "Loading your listings..." |
| Active Host | "Loading your listings..." |
| Power Host | "Loading..." |

**Rule:** Waiting copy is the same across personas except for extreme efficiency for power hosts. Never add "hang tight!" or "almost there!" to loading states.

---

### Empty States (No Data)

**All personas:** Helpful, forward-looking. But with different levels of detail.

| Persona | No Proposals Copy |
|---------|-------------------|
| New Host | "No proposals yet. When guests are interested, you'll see their proposals here." |
| Active Host | "No new proposals. Your listings are live and visible." |
| Power Host | "0 proposals pending." |

**Rule:** New hosts get the full explanation. Active hosts get a status confirmation. Power hosts get raw data.

---

### Urgent Actions (Proposal Expiring, Payout Issue)

**All personas:** Factual urgency, not emotional urgency. State the deadline, not the emotion.

| Persona | Copy |
|---------|------|
| New Host | "A proposal from Leo expires tomorrow. Respond by Feb 12 so they can finalize their plans." |
| Active Host | "Proposal from Leo expires Feb 12. Respond to keep it active." |
| Power Host | "1 proposal expiring Feb 12. Respond." |

**Rule:** Never use "URGENT," "ACT NOW," or "DON'T MISS THIS." State the date. Let the host decide their own urgency.

### DON'T: Ignore or spin bad news
~~"Your earnings are $1,200!" (when they were $1,300 last month, with no acknowledgment)~~
~~"Every month is a fresh start!"~~

---

### DO: Use numbers when they help
"Listings with photos get 3x more proposals."
"This usually takes about 5 minutes."

### DON'T: Use numbers to pressure
~~"Hosts who respond in 1 hour get 5x more bookings!"~~
~~"Only 3 spots left in the Featured Host program!"~~

## Persona Detection Logic

The system determines persona based on:

| Signal | New Host | Active Host | Power Host |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Listings created | 1 | 1-3 | 4+ |
| Completed bookings | 0 | 1-20 | 21+ |
| Account age | < 60 days | 60-365 days | > 365 days |
| Onboarding complete | No or partial | Yes | Yes |

**Tie-breaking:** If signals conflict (e.g., 4 listings but 0 bookings), default to the more supportive persona (New Host). It's better to over-support than under-support.

**Transition:** When a host crosses from New to Active (first completed booking + onboarding complete), the tone shift happens on their next login. No announcement ("You're now an Active Host!") — the change is subtle and felt, not stated.
